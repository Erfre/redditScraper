Ideas

So now onto the final design. What should the program do once it is downloaded and executed?
First off there won't be any database or images to choose from so the site should not be first
which means that I the start of the program will be the terminal prompt fetching results
from reddit and storing them into the database. This should from now on happen by the end of
each month.


After 100 of the top results this month is saved the program will move on and start
the webserver and tell the user to fill out the description for the images and delete bad
ones.

Then it's all on the bot to continue the voyage. And post the pictures and so on.



I could run the script once everyday and check what date it is
